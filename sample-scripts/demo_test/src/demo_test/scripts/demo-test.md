# This test demonstrates how you can run a robot test in a markdown file.

### Every test data file needs to include the `setup.robot`
| Settings | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Resource | setup.robot |

| Variables | Value | Value |
| --------- | ----- | ----- |
| ${echo_message} | goodbye |  |
| ${asdfasdf} | goodbye |  |
| @{test_list} | asdf | asdfa |
| ... | wsesdf | sdfsdf |
| &{test_dict} | asdf=1231 | asdfa=12312 |
| ... | sdfsdf=11111 | sdfssdf=12312 |

### Every test case needs to include `Setup` and `Teardown` sections which ensure to import the test and start and stop it properly

Keyword `Setup Remote` is introduced by `setup.robot`. It takes two arguments, the first one is the execution script that runs on the test endpoint, the second one is the test library alias which is used hereafter to call its keywords.
Keyword `Teardown Remote` is also introduced by `setup.robot`. It closes the test with some necessary work in the background.

| Test Cases | Action | Argument | Argument | Argument | Argument | Argument |

|  | [Setup] | Setup Remote | demo_test/demotest.py | testlib |  |  |
|  | [Teardown] | Teardown Remote |  |  |  |  |
